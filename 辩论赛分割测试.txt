\n\n\tOur view today is that adults should be more focused on the pros and cons.\n\n\tTo begin with, an adult is a person of legal age and sound mind who is an important part of society.\n\n\tPros and cons are the benefits and drawbacks that come from a holistic perspective.\n\n\tRight and wrong refers to the judgment on things formed by adults under the influence of education and environment.\n\n\tWhen adults enter society, another set of criteria different from right and wrong emerges when they face problems, namely, the pros and cons criteria.\n\n\tWhen we discuss which of these two sets of criteria should be emphasized by adults, we have to discuss which one of them is more in line with the developmental needs of adults in solving problems or dealing with events in a holistic manner.\n\n\tThe pros and cons we are discussing here are a holistic, considered judgment, so the comparison is made from two perspectives: the process and the end.\n\n\tFirst of all, focusing more on the pros and cons in the process will make adults clearer about their developmental goals.\n\n\tAdults enter the society and aspire for their own maximum development, they will encounter all kinds of problems and events in their development, and when there is a conflict between the criteria of right and wrong and the criteria of pros and cons, they should look at the whole picture and make rational judgments.\n\n\tThe process of solving problems and dealing with events determines the direction of adult development.\n\n\tIn the case of a conflict, the choice of the right approach, based on one's own personal principles, will lead to a deviation from the established direction of development, thus leading to the downside of the event or problem and a change in the goal of development.\n\n\tThus, only by focusing more on the pros and cons can we make our development goals clearer in adulthood.\n\n\tSecondly, the ending of focusing more on the pros and cons is more conducive to the expansion of the development space for adults.\n\n\tWe say that adults are constantly pursuing their own maximum development, but what we advocate is not just for their own interests, disregarding all other aspects, and blindly pursuing the maximization of interests.\n\n\tIn the end, we pay more attention to the pros and cons than to the rights and wrongs, and we come up with the results from a long-term perspective.\n\n\tWith the increase of adult social experience, for things a lot of understanding and awareness will change, for the right and wrong judgment will also change, and the pros and cons of the ending is reflected in the time, choose to use the pros and cons of the standard, not only is a rational understanding of the overall situation, but also a kind of insurance method.\n\n\tThe development of an adult not only requires personal efforts, but more importantly, whether the environment in which it is located provides opportunities for its development.\n\n\tThus, the ending is more conducive to expanding the space for adults to develop by focusing more on the pros and cons.\n\n\tWe recognize that there are many advantages and disadvantages to the right and wrong criteria in many situations, but taking a holistic view, a greater focus on the pros and cons can meet the developmental needs of adults in many different situations.\n\n\tPaying more attention to pros and cons is not a choice based on human tendency, nor is it on the opposite side of morality, it is only a choice criterion that is more favorable to adult development based on a combination of various factors.\n\n\tAdults face more and more layers of problems and events in society, the right and wrong more and more can not meet the development needs, pay more attention to the pros and cons in order to make the whole situation to achieve a satisfactory state, but also to realize the adults based on the society to continue to work hard desire.\n\n\tTherefore, we insist that adults should pay more attention to the pros and cons.\n\n\tThe pros and cons are the scales that weigh the choices that maximize the benefits.\n\n\tRight and wrong are our value judgments, which can be based on morals, laws, or our simplest sense of right and wrong.\n\n\tSometimes right and wrong are based on practical considerations in real situations, and while there are things where right and wrong are ambiguous, there are also times when the pros and cons are hard to distinguish.\n\n\tThere is a saying that interests tend to make us unable to see reality, which means that people tend to emphasize only immediate interests and ignore the whole picture and right and wrong.\n\n\tIt seems that today's era has gotten used to the word "profit" being first, and when we do this consistently, we can justifiably ignore right and wrong.\n\n\tUnder the wash of interests, we have become more and more smooth and worldly.\n\n\tWe often feel helpless and innocent, because we have to survive in this society, we have no choice (reality is not that bad how to do), adults only look at the pros and cons, children only distinguish between right and wrong.\n\n\tWe take this saying as a classic, find an excuse and continue to live for the time being.\n\n\tYet right and wrong are sometimes a contract in this society, a part of the responsibility that we all share.\n\n\tWhen we ignore this part of the undertaking in order to live better and a little better for ourselves, we say, what's the big deal, everyone does it, we'd be fools not to do it.\n\n\tIt may not be until one day, when we also become the sacrifice under the maximization of other people's interests, that we will know how good and fortunate it is for this society to have commitment, right and wrong, in order for us to live a truly better life.\n\n\tIn the movie, Sumi said that she has heard a lot of truths since she was a child, but she still can't live a good life.\n\n\tSo why don't we talk about the pros and cons and live a more realistic life? But what is reality, living a realistic life is not living a happy life.\n\n\tIn reality, we are often blinded by the immediate interests, and with their own easy and happy pass by.\n\n\tWhen we look back on the road we have traveled, we will find that they are often happy is not a momentary gain, but some of the purest good, is their own in the key moment is finally choose the right road, ask the heart without shame.\n\n\tChasing fame and fortune may make us get very good and nourishing, but when we sit on the couch and see a person fall from heaven to hell on TV, we will only realize when we feel proud and despise that what makes us live this life well is right and wrong after all.\n\n\tSo we should feel grateful that the rationality and wisdom of adulthood has freed us from the mere pros and cons of what it takes to live well.\n\n\tThis is a hopeless debate and a hopeless position.\n\n\tAfter all is said and done, someone will eventually ask anxiously, "Isn't it ludicrous for you to ask me to speak of right and wrong in a time like today."\n\n\tIndeed, such a question is not mean-spirited, but this century, we have been in the heart of the doubt: the material century, where is the spiritual home?\n\n\tIn fact, there is no home in the world, and when longing meets longing, there is a home.
